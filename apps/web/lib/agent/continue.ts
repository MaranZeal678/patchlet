/**
 * Continuing a walkthrough that is already under way.
 *
 * The user is mid-flow with a caption on their screen and their hand on the mouse, so this path
 * spends nothing on work the first turn already did. It reuses that turn's answer and its
 * documentation evidence, reads the page as it looks now, and asks one small model for the steps
 * that are left. No understanding call, no probes, no verdict.
