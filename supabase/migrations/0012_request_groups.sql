-- Feature requests are grouped before anything is filed.
--
-- The same gap reaches the agent many times, worded differently every time. Filing one issue per
-- conversation buries the developers and hides the signal that matters: how many people hit this.
-- So every drafted request is embedded and matched against the groups this project already has.
-- A near match joins the group and raises its counts; anything else starts a new group.
--
-- A group carries its own weight (how often it was detected, how often a user asked for it
-- explicitly) and its own state on GitHub, so the issue and the pull request belong to the group
-- rather than to whichever conversation happened to be first.
